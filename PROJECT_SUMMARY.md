## 🎯 Target Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **Ethiopian Developers**: Dealing with frequent power outages and unreliable internet
- **University Students**: Limited internet access during campus hours
- **Remote Developers**: Working in areas with poor connectivity
- **Teams in Developing Regions**: Sharing cached packages locally

### Use Case Scenarios

1. **University Environment**
   - Download packages during campus hours with good internet
   - Work offline during power outages
   - Share cache with other students

2. **Co-working Spaces**
   - Sync packages during reliable connection periods
   - Work offline when internet is unstable
   - Team collaboration with shared cache

3. **Remote Development**
   - Cache packages before traveling to areas with poor connectivity
   - Continue development work offline
   - Sync when connectivity returns

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
# Install Zembil globally
npm install -g zembil
